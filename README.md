# Principal Component Analysis (PCA) Project

## Overview

This repository contains files and code related to a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) study on two datasets: `loan_train.csv` and `smoking.csv`. The analysis is documented in the `PCA analysis.Rmd` file, with the resulting report available in `pca.pdf`.

## Files

1. **loan_train.csv**
   - Dataset containing information related to loans.

2. **PCA analysis.Rmd**
   - R Markdown file containing the code and documentation for the PCA analysis.

3. **pca.pdf**
   - Compiled PDF report summarizing the PCA analysis.

4. **smoking.csv**
   - Dataset providing survey data on smoking habits in the UK.

## How to Use

1. Open the `PCA analysis.Rmd` file in an R environment or an R Markdown viewer.
2. Run the code chunks sequentially to perform the PCA analysis.
3. Review the compiled report in `pca.pdf` for insights and visualizations.

## Analysis Details

### Loan Data Analysis:

- Investigates the loan dataset, exploring relationships and patterns through PCA.
- Provides insights into the key components contributing to variance.

### UK Smoking Data Analysis:

- Explores UK smoking habits dataset, focusing on demographic characteristics and tobacco consumption.
- Utilizes PCA to identify key factors and relationships within the data.
